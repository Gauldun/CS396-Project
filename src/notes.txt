General idea: Major game loop will be held within the main.zig file. The majority (if not all) of the procedural/imperative design will be held in this file.
Major function calls, object creation will be held in this file.

On the other hand, there should be some functional aspect held within the systems.zig file or another file [something like funcSystems.zig].
There's a need for PURE functions with zero side-effects to display functional programming behavior. These functions can then be called within another,
what would/could be imperative, function.

There needs to be functions that can recalculate these character stats as needed.
Imperative functions can then utilize these functions to deploy several different effects onto to the game as needed.
The main file can then take the imperative functions for general game procedure.

Character stats should include; health, damage, speed, range, and possibly stress
Item stats should be able to functionally decrease/increase character stats whether it be a consumption item or permanent item like a trinket.

Other possible stats to be added would be 'elemental resistance', 'elemental effects', or 'unique stats/effects'.
